# HaikuBot

This simple bot provides you with funny or interesting short videos from https://reddit.com/r/YoutubeHaiku.

The definition for 'Youtube Haiku' from the subreddit itself is as follows:
'Youtube Haiku: Any almost poetic video under 14 seconds. Don't ask me why 14 seconds;
it's just a number I have learned from experience.
Videos can still be poetic after 15 or longer, but no longer than 30 seconds.'
